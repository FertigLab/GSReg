Description: A package for gene set analysis based on the variability
    of expressions as well as a method to detect Alternative Splicing Events .
	It implements DIfferential RAnk Conservation (DIRAC) and 
	gene set Expression Variation Analysis (EVA) methods. For detecting Differentially Spliced genes, 
	it provides an implementation of the Spliced-EVA (SEVA).
